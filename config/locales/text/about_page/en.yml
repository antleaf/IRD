      ### About the service

      The International Repositories Directory (IRD) is managed by the [Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR)](https://www.coar-repositories.org/).

      #### Criteria for Inclusion

      Each repository in this directory is satisfies the following criteria:

      - The majority of its content is fully Open Access
      - It supports OAI-PMH

      #### Management of the Data
      The metadata in this directory is harvested from the repositories themselves, and is updated on a regular basis. Some of the metadata is updated automatically, but the metadata records are also curated by organisations called "Responsible Organisations" which allocate people and resources to maintain the accuracy and timeliness of the metadata.

      #### License
      The data in the IRD may be re-used without restriction. More formally, it is licensed under the [CC0 License](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/?ref=chooser-v1).

      #### Software Development and Maintenance
